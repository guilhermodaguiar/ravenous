The first part of the project is in branch "part_1". 
Here is a review for what is built in the first part of the Revenous project:


A Business component that simulates a single business
A BusinessList component that simulates a list of single businesses
A SearchBar component that will be used in the future to search for business
The App component renders a SearchBar component and a BusinessList component. The final product is a simulation of how the Ravenous project will look and work. Some functionality (like querying the Yelp API) is currently missing, but youâ€™ll build it in the upcoming projects.

Reflect on the knowledge you used in this project. As you do so, consider the following question:

At the moment, some information (like busine_ss information) is hard coded into specific components. How might you pass this information dynamically between components?
